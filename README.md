# Gnome-config-watcher

Run this program to monitor configuration changes made by programs which use the gnome GConf library.

# Why?

I use Chef to configure my computers. Instead of manually configuring all the settings which make each of my computers "perfect" I can monitor the changes on one computer and programmatically configure the others.

This program enables me to discover the settings I'm changing.
